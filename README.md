This repository includes a collection of code, taken from various projects, for genetic processing and analysis.

ConditionalAnalysis: Stores code for performing stepwise indirect meta-analysis, which was used to select markers for assessing the risk of psortiatic arthritis (PsA) among psoriasis patients.

CombineImputationPanels: Combines association results from Plink using two different reference panels (1000 genomes and HRC). The scripts provided illustrate a specific use case for PsV vs. Control association, and it is assumed imputation was conducted using Minimac3. For other use cases, the scripts will need to be slightly adapted.
