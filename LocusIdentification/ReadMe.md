This tool will identify genome-wide and suggestively significant loci from GWAS summary statistics, based on their p-value and distance from each other.

For an illustration of our goal, see this Manhattan plot: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_plot#/media/File:Manhattan_Plot.png

Other suggested ideas include finding loci in proximity to previously reported loci, or comparing two different sets of summary statistics.
